# WSO2 API Manager Deployment Patterns


## Pattern 1: Single node (all-in-one)Â deployment

You can use this pattern when you are working with low throughput.

## Pattern 2: Deployment with a separate Gateway and separate Key Manager

You can use this pattern when you require a high throughput scenario that requires a shorter token lifespan.

## Pattern 3: Fully distributed setup

You can use this pattern to maintain scalability at each layer and higher flexibility at each component.

## Pattern 4: Internal and external (on-premise) API Management

[![Internal and external API-M]({{base_path}}/assets/img/setup-and-install/4-internal-and-external.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/setup-and-install/4-internal-and-external.png)

You can use this pattern when you require a separate internal and external API Management with separate Gateway instances.

## Pattern 5: Internal and external (public and private cloud) API Management

You can use this pattern when you wish to maintain a cloud deployment as an external API Gateway layer.

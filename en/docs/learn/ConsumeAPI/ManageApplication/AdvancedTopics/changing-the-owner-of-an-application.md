# Changing the Owner of an Application

If required, you can transfer the ownership of your application to another user in your organization. Thereby, when transferring ownership the new owner will have the required permission to delete or edit the respective application.

For example, let's consider that Chris and Kim are in the same organization and that Chris owns TestApp and that Chris wants to transfer the ownership of TestApp to Kim.

Follow the instructions below to change the ownership of an application:

!!! warning
The transfer application ownership feature is only available as a WUM update and is effective from 29th January 2019 (29-01-2019). For more information on updating WSO2 API Manager, see [Updating WSO2 API Manager](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM300/Updating+WSO2+API+Manager) .


1.  Start the WSO2 API-M Server.
2.  If the users do not exist in the system, create them.
    Sign in to the WSO2 API-M Management Console and create two users named Chris and Kim with the `Internal/subscriber` role.
`https://<APIM-hostname>:9443/carbon/          `

3.  Check the details of the application that you wish to share in the Store (e.g., TestApp).

    1.  Sign in to the WSO2 API-M Store using the application owner's (Chris's) user credentials.
`https://<APIM-hostname>:9443/store/            `

    2.  If the application does not exist, create it in the Store.

4.  Change the ownership of the application.
    1.  Sign in to the WSO2 API-M Admin Portal using admin credentials.
`https://<APIM-hostname>:9443/admin/            `

    2.  Click **Applications** under **Settings** .
        This shows you the list of applications together with the respective owners.

    3.  Search for the application that you want to share and click **Edit** .

    4.  Update the **Owner** field with the new owner's username (Kim).

                !!! tip
        Troubleshooting

        If you get a " `<usernane> is not a subscriber` " error (e.g., Kim is not a subscriber) in the Admin Portal, make sure to request that specific user (e.g., Kim) to sign in to the WSO2 Store, because users are not added as subscribers until they log in to the Store at least once.


        The application page shows the new ownership.
        ![]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/126559224/126559226.png)        Now, when Chris signs in to the Store, the TestApp does not appear, and when Kim signs in to the Store the TestApp appears under the application list.

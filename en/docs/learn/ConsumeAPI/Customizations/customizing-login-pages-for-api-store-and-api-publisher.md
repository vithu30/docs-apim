# Customizing Login Pages for API Store and API Publisher

Custom pages for logging into the server are available for SAML2 SSO, OAuth and OpenID. This section guides you through this customization.

The login pages and other pages like error and notification screens of SAML SSO, OAuth, OpenID and Passive STS are located in the authenticationendpoint webapp file found at `<APIM_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps` .

You can easily customize these pages within this web application by changing the respective JSPs, JavaScript and CSS. If you want to point to a different web application, you can do so by redirecting or forwarding from **authenticationendpoint** to your webapp. In the case of SAML SSO, the 'issuer' id of the service provider is also sent to this webapp. Therefore, different login pages can be given to different service providers by looking at the 'issuer' request parameter.

The following is a sample of how to customize the login page for SAML2 SSO.

### Customizing the login page for SAML SSO service providers

Usually WSO2 API Manager displays a default login page for all the SAML SSO service providers that send authentication requests to it. The following steps indicate how to change the default login page into a customized one.

-   [Configuring the login page](#CustomizingLoginPagesforAPIStoreandAPIPublisher-Configuringtheloginpage)

#### Registering the two service providers in the Identity Server

1.  Download [WSO2 Identity Server](http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/) and extract it.

2.  [Run the server](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS530/Running+the+Product) by executing wso2is-5.0.0/bin/wso2server.sh if on a Unix-based systems, or /bin/wso2server.bat if on Windows.

3.  On the [management console](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS530/Getting+Started+with+the+Management+Console) , click Add under Service Providers in the Main menu.

4.  Enter "publisher" as the Service Provider Name in the form that appears and click Register.

5.  In the page that appears next, expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section. Click **Configure** . The Register New Service Provider page appears.

    -   Issuer: api\_publisher

    -   Assertion Consumer URL: <https://10.100.5.83:9443/publisher/jagg/jaggery_acs.jag>

    -   Select Enable Response Signing

    -   Select Enable Single Logout

6.  Repeat steps 1 to 5 and configure the following details for store.

    -   Issuer: api\_store

    -   Assertion Consumer URL: <https://10.100.5.83:9443/store/jagg/jaggery_acs.jag>

    -   Select Enable Response Signing

    -   Select Enable Single Logout

7.  When attempting to login with SAML from WSO2 Identity Server in API publisher and API store, you can see the following default page located at `<IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/webapps/authenticationendpoint/login.jsp          `

#### Configuring the login page

##### Understanding the authenticationendpoint web application

The login page that is displayed during SAML2 SSO, OAuth, OpenID and Passive-STS flows is located inside the webapp named authenticationendpoint. The reason for storing this in a web app is:

-   to easily customize the page according to user requirements

-   if needed, place that whole web application in an external application server

The Identity Server knows the location of this web application as it is specified in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/application-authentication.xml` configuration file. This is referenced as shown below.

``` java
    <AuthenticationEndpointURL>/authenticationendpoint/login.do</AuthenticationEndpointURL>
    <AuthenticationEndpointRetryURL>/authenticationendpoint/retry.do</AuthenticationEndpointRetryURL>
```

By default it points to a location inside the Identity Server itself, thus the relative path is given. If it is necessary to point to an external application, the full path should be given instead.

!!! info
If this web app is moved outside the Identity Server, we must ensure that no one can access the login credentials that are passed between this application and the Identity Server. This means that the external location should ideally be either inside a secured intranet or the transport should be HTTPS. Other similar precautions may be necessary to secure the communication.

The following is the structure of this web app.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QOoN6rTi-3ScdoSfWcRtnbcb1kViYyBWr9vAcdsg7RoMHqfFMCnSX5a2mD--kg-y7Uz4_4e1cH7xsKW8CxJ_2IECUmVVu5L6CSGIdDp948cpvhKfZkyu2hRywbnFJ3eW9AXJd3cr)
The **authenticationendpoint** web application uses a carbon component called `org.wso2.carbon.identity.application.authentication.endpoint.util.` This bundle includes a filter called the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.application.authentication.endpoint.util.filter.AuthenticationEndpointFilter` , which acts as the Front Controller.

When a request is made to the **authenticationendpoint** web application, based on the authentication protocol type identified by the request parameter ‘type’, the controller first forwards the request to the protocol based login url patterns defined. For example, if the request to the **authenticationendpoint** web application is initiated as a result of a SAML SSO authentication request, the controller will forward the request to the url pattern `/samlsso_login.do` . If you look inside the **web.xml** , you will see that this url pattern is mapped to the **login.jsp** file. The request is finally forwarded to this **login.jsp** page.

Everything on the **authententicationendpoint** web application is customizable. You can customize it by adding JSP pages or modifying them and configuring the web.xml respectively.

The only restriction involved is that the content already sent back by the pages inside the default web app must be submitted to the Identity Server. Additionally, you must point to the correct location via the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/application-authentication.xml` file.

##### Customizing the login page

When a request comes to the default login page, you can see several parameters being passed in the address bar. For this customization, the focus is on the following two parameters:

-   **sessionDataKey** : This is an identifier used by the Identity Server to maintain state information related to this particular request by the service provider.

-   **relyingParty** : This is the value we gave for the "Issuer" field when we registered the SAML2 SSO service provider (e.g., [travelocity.com](http://travelocity.com) ). This value is used to display different login pages to different service providers.

When customizing the pages, ensure that the following is applied.

1.  Form submissions should happen to the "commonauth" servlet as a POST.
`<form id="form" name="form" action="../../commonauth" method="POST">          `

2.  Make sure to send back the "sessionDataKey" with the form submission, by using a hidden input field.
`<input type="hidden" name="sessionDataKey" value="<%=request.getParameter("sessionDataKey")%>"/>          `

##### Using a JSP to redirect to SP relevant pages

1.  Rename the existing 'login.jsp' to 'default\_login.jsp'

2.  Create a new file with the name 'login.jsp' including the following code.

    ``` java
        <%
        String relyingParty = request.getParameter("relyingParty");
    if (relyingParty.equals("api_publisher")) {
     RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("publisher_login.jsp");
     dispatcher.forward(request, response);
    } else if (relyingParty.equals("api_store")) {
      RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("store_login.jsp");
      dispatcher.forward(request, response);
    }
    else {
     RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("default_login.jsp");
     dispatcher.forward(request, response);
    }
    %>
    ```
    This code snippet forwards the request to a different login page by checking the value of relyingParty parameter.

3.  Get the ' publisher\_login.jsp ' from [here](https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/people/roshan/) and place it at the same level as 'login.jsp'. Also, download the contents of the 'css'  folders from that same link and put them inside the respective folders in the authenticationendpoint.

4.  Log in to the publisher web app again. You are presented with a different page.

5.  Follow steps 1 to 4 to configure the custom login page to the store web app.

### Introduction

This page shows the artifacts that were deployed as well as the artifacts that were deleted during the selected time period. It also indicates the number of times each artifact was deployed/deleted. In each gadget, you can search for a specific API and sort the APIs in the ascending/descending order by the available fields

### Purpose

This page allows you to:

-   View statistics for all the APIs deployed in your WSO2 API Manager installation.
-   Check the status for each API (i.e. whether it is available for use or deleted).
-   Understand the extent to which each API is used by checking the frequency with which they were deployed/deleted.

### Recommended Action

Compare the frequency with which different APIs are deployed/deleted to identify the most frequently used APIs.

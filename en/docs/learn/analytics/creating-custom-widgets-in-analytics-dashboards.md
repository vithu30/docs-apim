#Creating Custom Widgets

In addition to already available widgets in the analytics dashboards, you can implement your own custom widget and use them across the dashboards.

A widget in Analytics dashboard is a ReactJS component that can be used to visualize information. A widget can have any static or interactive visualizations such as charts, tables, filters with drill down and inter widget communication capabilities.

In order to identify a particular ReactJS component  as a widget by the dashboard, it needs to register itself as a widget in the portal.

WSO2 analytics-apim consists a widget generator tool to automatically generate the widget skeleton by taking the user preferences through the command-line tool.


##Creating APIMApiTraffic Widget

Let’s assume that APIMApiTraffic widget is a subscriber widget and uses SiddhiDataProvider to retrieve the data. Follow the instructions mentioned below to create the widget.

1. Navigate to the `<HOME>/wso2/tools/generator-widget` directory and issue the following command to install dependencies.

    ```
       sudo npm install    
    ```
   Hereafter, above directory will be referred as `<TOOL_HOME>`.
   
2. Open a new terminal in `<TOOL_HOME>` directory and issue the following command to generate the widget template.

    ```
       npm run createwidget--widgettype:subscriber--dataprovider:SiddhiDataProvider    
    ```
   Now, you will be asked to provide the widget name and the  widget heading.
   
3. Provide the widget name as `APIMApiTraffic` and widget heading as `Total Traffic`.

4. Based on the user preferences, widget skeleton will be created inside the `<TOOL_HOME>/widgetTemplates` directory and the relevant dependencies will be installed to the `<TOOL_HOME>/widgetTemplates/APIMApiTraffic` directory, which will be hereafter referred as `<WIDGET_ROOT>`.

5. Following file structure will be created inside the `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory.
     ```
     APIMApiTraffic
     ├── src
     │   ├── resources
     │   │     └──widgetConf.json
     │   └── APIMApiTrafficWidget.jsx  
     ├── package.json
     └── webpack.config.js
     ```

6. Following is a brief description about what each file does.

    1.  **Package.json** </br>
         Package.json file holds metadata relevant to the widget. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the widget as well as handle the dependencies.
         <table>

         </table>
    
    2.  **widgetConf.json** </br>
            This contains the meta information of the widget such as widget ID, widget name and configurations. Following are the main configurations included in the  widgetConf.json file.
           -   `pubsub` - To declare  whether the widget is a publisher or subscriber in the publisher-subscriber concept.
                
            !!! note
                    The analytics-dashboard allows inter-widget communication via publisher/subscriber model. In the publisher/subscriber approach the publisher or the sender sends messages without specifically targeting a subscriber or a receiver. The receiver individually declares the interest in one or more messages published by a particular publisher or set of publishers.
           
           -   `providerConfig` - To declare the data source and the queries from which the data is fetched. You have the ability to write many queries here and select the specific query in runtime,  and also you can use query templates in the default query and assemble it in  runtime.
           -   `options` - Used to integrate the header removing facility to widgets.

    3. **Webpack.config.js**</br>
        `Webpack.config.js` is basically used to configure the entry point and the output result directory of the widget, by default it will assume that the entry point of your widget is `src/index` and will output the result in `dist/main.js` minified and optimized for production.</br>
        Furthermore, below properties are included in the `Webpack.config.js` file
        -   **context** : The Base directory to resolve entry points and loaders.
        -   **entry**   : Application execution starting point.
        -   **output**  : options related to how webpack emits results.
        -   **module**  : configuration regarding modules.
        -   **plugins** : Used to customize the webpack build process in a variety of ways.

7. Issue the following commands in the `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory to start a node development environment and create a symlink from `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory to `<ANALYTICS_HOME>/wso2/dashboard/deployment/web-ui-apps/analytics-dashboard/extensions/widgets` directory.
    ```
       npm run dev
       npm run symlink    
    ```
    
    !!! note
            Creating a development environment and symlink, will instantly update the changes to the UI. You do not need to restart the dashboard profile every time to see the changes.
    
8. Start the dashboard profile of the analytics server.

    !!! note
            If you have already started the dashboard profile, restart the dashboard profile to render the new widget to the dashboard.
        
9. Now log in to the Dashboard portal and create a new dashboard .
   For instructions to create a new dashboard, see [Creating New Dashboards](https://docs.wso2.com/display/SP440/Creating+New+Dashboards).
   
10. You can view the newly created APIMApiTraffic widget in the widget listing panel of the Dashboard Designer. Drag and drop the APIMApiTraffic widget to the dashboard.

    !!! note
            APIMApiTraffic widget is a subscriber widget and retrieve published data, To configure a publisher widget, drag and drop the DateTimeRangePicker widget to the same page.
        
11. Click on the configuration icon in the top-left of the APIMApiTraffic widget. This will open up “Widget configurations” panel which lists all the publishers in the dashboard.

12. Select the Date time Range,
    
    ![APIMApiTraffic configurations](../../assets/img/learn/apim-apitraffic-configurations.png)

    Now you have successfully configured the APIMApiTraffic widget to retrieve the published data.
    
    Now you understand how to develop a widget and get it rendered in the Dashboard portal. Now lets retrieve traffic data from the database and display them on the widget.
    
##Create database configuration for the APIMApiTrafficwidget

1.  Navigate to the `<WIDGET_ROOT>/src/resources` directory and replace the following configurations of the `widgetConf.json` file.

    !!! note
            -   Data providers are the sources from which information is fetched to be displayed in widgets, you can use either SiddhiStoreDataProvider or RDBMSDataProvider.Please refer [Working with data providers](https://docs.wso2.com/display/SP440/Working+with+Data+Providers#WorkingwithDataProviders-SiddhiStoreDataProvider) section for more Information about data providers.
            -   In order to retrieve data , you must create a Siddhi app and a Siddhi query, please refer the [Siddhi query guide](https://siddhi.io/en/v5.1/docs/query-guide/) for more information.
            -   `publishingInterval` refers to the frequency with which you want the data provider to poll data from the Siddhi store. The time interval is specified in seconds.
        
2.  Navigate to the `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory and update the content of the `APIMApiTrafficWidget.jsx` file as follows to handle the data received from the query.    
    1. Declare a new variable named `usageData` and add it to the state.
    ```
       this.state = {
            usageData: null,
       };
    ```  
    2. Modify the `queryName` parameter of the assembleQuery method as `apiUsageQuery`.
    ```
       dataProviderConfigs.configs.config.queryData.queryName = 'apiusagequery';
    ```   
    3. Update the `handleQueryResults` method as follows to format the retrieved data.
    ```
       handleQueryResults(message) {
            const { data } = message;
            if (data) {
                const usageData = [];
                data.forEach((dataUnit) => {
                    usageData.push({
                        API: dataUnit[0] + '(' + dataUnit[1] + ')', Traffic: dataUnit[2],
                    });
                });    
                this.setState({ usageData });
            }
       }
    ```

##Create Traffic Chart to display data
1.  Navigate to `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory and create a functional component named `TrafficChart.jsx`. </br>
    Now the directory structure inside the `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory will be as follows.
    ```
     APIMApiTraffic
     ├── dist
     ├── node_modules
     ├── src
     │   ├── resources
     │   ├── APIMApiTrafficWidget.jsx     
     │   └── TrafficChart.jsx  
     ├── package.json
     └── webpack.config.js
    ```
    
2.  Update the `TrafficChart.jsx` as follows.
    ```
       import React from 'react';
       import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
       import { VictoryBar, VictoryChart, VictoryAxis } from 'victory';
       
       export default function TrafficChart(props) {
           const { data } = props;
           const  styles = {
               victorybar: {
                   display: 'flex',
                   flexWrap: 'wrap',
                   data: { fill: 'rgb(0, 107, 201)', width: 5 },
               },
               victoryaxis: {
                   axisLabel: {
                       padding: 30,
                       fill: '#fff',
                       fontsize: '8px',
                   },
               },
           };
       
           const chartTheme = {
               axis: {
                   style:  {
                       tickLabels: {
                           fill: '#fff',
                           fontSize: '8px',
                           angle: 45,
                       },
                       grid: { stroke: 'none' },
                   },
               },
           };
       
           return (
               <VictoryChart
                   theme={chartTheme}
                   domainPadding={{ '{{' }} x: 30 }}
                   maxDomain={{ '{{' }} x: 5 }}
                   height={245}
               >
                   <VictoryBar
                       barWidth={6}
                       cornerRadius={{ '{{' }} topRight: 5 }}
                       style={styles.victorybar}
                       animate={{ '{{' }}
                           duration: 1000,
                           onLoad: { duration: 500 },
                       }}
                       data={data}
                       x='API'
                       y='Traffic'
                   />
                   <VictoryAxis
                       label='Api Name'
                       style={styles.victoryaxis}
                   />
                   <VictoryAxis
                       dependentAxis
                       label='Total Traffic'
                       style={styles.victoryaxis}
                   />
               </VictoryChart>
           );
       }
       
       TrafficChart.propTypes = {
           data: PropTypes.instanceOf(Object).isRequired,
           themeName: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
       }; 
    ```

    !!! note
               The VictoryJs is a react js library for modular charting and data visualization. You can find the required information about victoryJs in the official [victoryJs](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) documentation.In order to create charts using victoryJs we need to install the victoryJs as a dependency to the widget. Follow the steps mentioned below to install victoryJS as a dependency.</br>
           -    Navigate to `<WIDGET_ROOT>` directory  and add `victoryJS` as a dependency to the `package.json` file.
                ```
                   "dependencies": {
                            "victory": "^31.0.2"
                   },  
                ```
           -   Issue the following command to install the dependency
                ```
                   npm install
                ```
            
3. Modify the `APIMApiTrafficWidget.jsx` as below to pass the Traffic data to the `TrafficChart.jsx` file.
   ```
      import TrafficChart from './TrafficChart';
      
      class APIMApiTrafficWidget extends Widget {
          
          render() {
            
              const { usageData } = this.state;
              
              return (
                  <TrafficChart
                      data={usageData}
                  />
              );
          }
      }
   ```
 
4. Refresh the dashboard to view the changes.

    Once you finished modifying the widget, you can issue the following command to build the widget, then the widget will be permanently deployed.     

    ```
       npm run build
    ```
    Then you can add the new widget to the analytics dashboard selecting from the widget listings.

Each violation type is displayed with a specific status in the relevant bar. Move the cursor over the relevant bar as demonstrated below to view the exact count for each violation type.

### Purpose

This gadget allows you to:

-   View the overall count of different errors that have occurred relating to application errors during a selected time interval.
-   View detailed information for each occurrence under a selected access token error category to investigate the reason for its occurrence.
-   View the 100 logs before and after an error to carry out further investigations about the reason for its occurrence.

### Recommended action

-   Compare the access token error count for different time periods. If the count is particularly high for a specific time interval, check for unusual events that have occurred during that time interval (e.g., system downtime).
-   Click on individual error categories and view all the records for that category in the **API Key Status** table. View the details of the individual errors and identify any common issues that cause those errors (e.g., a specific user requiring a change in his/her credentials).
-   If an error is unique and the its cause cannot be identified by checking detailed information in the **API Key Status** table, view other logs that were generated immediately before and after the error in the **Log Viewer** gadget.

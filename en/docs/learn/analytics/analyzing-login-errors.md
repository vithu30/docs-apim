### Introduction

This page indicates the number of login attempt failures that have occurred during the selected time interval in a bar chart as shown in the example below. The exact count for a specific unit of time (e.g., day, hour, etc.) can be viewed by moving the cursor over the relevant bar.

### Purpose

This page allows you to identify the time periods during which login errors have occurred to understand what caused them.

### Recommended action

Compare the count for failed login errors at different time intervals. If the count is particularly high during specific time intervals, check for any unusual occurrences that may have taken place during that time (e.g., system downtime). If a high count for login errors is observed for all time intervals, check the relevant configurations in WSO2 API Manager (e.g., configuration of users and user roles).

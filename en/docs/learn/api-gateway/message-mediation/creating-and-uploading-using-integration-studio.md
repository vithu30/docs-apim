# Creating and Uploading using WSO2 Integration Studio

From API-M-3.0.0 onwards you can design all custom mediation policies using a tool such as the WSO2 Integration Studio and then store the policy in the registry which can be later deployed to the Gateway.

Let's see how to create a custom mediation policy using the WSO2 Integration Studio and then deploy and use it in your APIs.
This custom policy adds a full trace log which is getting printed when you invoke a particular API deployed in the Gateway.

1.  Navigate to the Integration Studio page - <https://wso2.com/integration/integration-studio/>
2.  Click **Download** button according to your preferred platform (i.e., Mac, Windows, Linux).  
*For example if you are using ubuntu 64 bit computer you need to download, WSO2-Integration-Studio-7.0.0-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz.*
3.  Extract the downloaded archive of the Integration Studio to the desired location and run the **IntegrationStudio** application to start the tool.

4.  Click **ESB Project -> Create New** to create a new ESB Solution Project.

5.  Provide **Project Name** as `TestProject` and click **Finish**. Then you will be redirected to the following page.

6.  Navigate to the directory path **TestProject -> src -> main -> synapse-config -> sequences** in **Project Explorer** 
window.
  
    [![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/api-gateway/message-mediation/sequences.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/api-gateway/message-mediation/sequences.png)

7.  Right-Click on **sequences** directory and go to **New -> Sequence** to create a new sequence.  
    If you want to import existing sequence proceed with **Import Sequence** option.

8.  Create new sequence and provide sequence name `newSequence` and click **Finish**.

9.  Your sequence now appears on the Integration Studio console.   
    Drag and drop a **Log Mediator** from under the **Mediators** section, to your sequence and give the following values 
    to the **Log Mediator** and **Save** the file `newSequence.xml`.

    `Log Level:  Full`

10. Right click the sequence file `newSequence.xml`, and goto **WSO2 registry -> Check in to WSO2 Registry**. You will be
prompted with the following dialog box.

11. On the dialog box that appears, enter the URL of the `WSO2 Publisher Portal` and click the Right top icon to open the **Registry Tree Browser**. 

12. From **Registry Tree Browser**, locate the path where the sequence is needed to be added `(IN/OUT/FAULT)`.

13. Then click **OK** and **Checkin**.

14. After that you can check **Registry Browser** in **WSO2 Management Console** to verify whether the sequence is successfully added.

15. Log in to the **API Publisher Portal**. 

16. Click **CREATE API** and then design a new REST API to create an API by following the steps in [Create a REST API]({{base_path}}/learn/design-api/create-api/create-a-rest-api/).

17. Go to the created API and from the Left Menu, go to **Runtime Configurations**.

18. Click [![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/api-gateway/message-mediation/edit-button.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/api-gateway/message-mediation/edit-button.png) button in the **Message Mediation** section under **Request** sub-menu.  

19. In the Select a Mediation Policy popup, select **Common Policies** and select the newly added `newSequence` from the 
sequence list. Then, click **Select**.

20. If the API is not in `PUBLISHED` state, go to **Lifecycle** tab, click `REDPLOY` to re-publish the API. 

21. When you invoke the API using a valid subscription, you can see the following trace log in the server logs.

    ``` bash
    [2019-12-19 15:27:30,770]  INFO - LogMediator To: /test/1.0, MessageID: urn:uuid:042a64ab-590a-4128-bd99-ef6974893610, Direction: request, Envelope: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?><soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"><soapenv:Body/></soapenv:Envelope

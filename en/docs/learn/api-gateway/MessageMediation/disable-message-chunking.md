# Disable Message Chunking

When processing large messages, message chunking facilitates sending the message as multiple independent chunks. 
Message chunking is set using the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header. However, some legacy backends might not support 
chunked messages.Â To disable sending chunked messages to the backend for a specific API, follow the steps below:

1.  Create an `XML` file with the following content:

    ``` xml
    <sequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="disableChunkingSeq">
        <property name="DISABLE_CHUNKING" value="true" scope="axis2"/>
    </sequence>
    ```

2.  Use the same sequence and apply it as a mediation extension to the inflow of this particular API. For more details, 
see [Creating per-API extensions](../../../Extensions/adding-mediation-extensions#creating-per-api-extensions). 
Once the API is published, chunking is disabled for the message that is sent to the backend.

    <div class="admonition info">
        <p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
        <p>
            To stop chunked messages from being sent to the client, you can apply the same mediation extension to the 
            out sequence as well.

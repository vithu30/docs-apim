# JMX Monitoring

Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a technology that lets you implement management interfaces for Java applications. **JConsole** is a JMX-compliant monitoring tool, which comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5 or later versions. Therefore, when you use a WSO2 product, JMX is enabled by default, which allows you to monitor the product using JConsole.

!!! info
Go to the [WSO2 Administration Guide](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/JMX-Based+Monitoring) for detailed instructions on how to configure JMX for a WSO2 product and how to use **JConsole** for monitoring a product.


### MBeans for WSO2 API Manager

When JMX is enabled, WSO2 ESBAPI Manager exposes a number of management resources as JMX MBeans that can be used for managing and monitoring the running server. When you start JConsole, you can monitor these MBeans from the **MBeans** tab. While some of these MBeans ( **ServerAdmin** and **DataSource** ) are common to all WSO2 products, some MBeans are specific to WSO2 API Manager.

!!! tip
The common MBeans are explained in detail in the [WSO2 Administration Guide](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/JMX-Based+Monitoring) . Listed below are the MBeans that are specific to WSO2 API Manager.

This section summarizes the attributes and operations available for the following ESB specific MBeans:

-   Connection MBeans
-   Latency MBeans
-   Threading MBeans
-   Transport MBeans

#### Connection MBeans

These MBeans provide connection statistics for the HTTP and HTTPS transports.

You can view the following Connection MBeans:

-`org.apache.synapse/PassThroughConnections/http-listener`
-`org.apache.synapse/PassThroughConnections/http-sender`
-`org.apache.synapse/PassThroughConnections/https-listener`
